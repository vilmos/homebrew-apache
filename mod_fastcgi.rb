    You must manually edit #{apache_configdir}/httpd.conf to contain:
      LoadModule fastcgi_module #{libexec}/mod_fastcgi.so

    Upon restarting Apache, you should see the following message in the error log:
      [notice] FastCGI: process manager initialized

    NOTE: If you're _NOT_ using --with-brewed-httpd22 or --with-brewed-httpd24 and having
    installation problems relating to a missing `cc` compiler and `OSX#{MACOS_VERSION}.xctoolchain`,
    read the "Troubleshooting" section of https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-apache
