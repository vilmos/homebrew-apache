Homebrew-apache
===============

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap homebrew/apache` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/apache/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-apache/master/<formula>.rb
```
